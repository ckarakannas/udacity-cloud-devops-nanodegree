# Static Website Hosting project - Chris Travel Blog

## Contents

In this folder, you will find 7 screenshots, numbered in a chronological manner, that demonstrate the steps taken to manually host a static website on AWS with S3 and Cloudfront.

You can access (subject to availability) and review the website through a CloudFront [endpoint](https://d3tad7qipx1i6z.cloudfront.net/).

The website content has been modified to include:

- Custom image background from another holiday destination
- Modified title and navbar title link ("Experience the World")
- A post.html page/endpoint sample to demonstrate redirection from and back to the home index.html page
